    <h2> Dear diary,</h2>
    <p> I love school shopping so much. School shopping has so many things. Just like notebooks, pens, and markers. I really love to go shopping for new notebooks. Like really cute ones of course! </p>
    <p> Even if I hate throwing out my old school stuff, I love getting new things. But soon I am going to get a new backpack and shoes. Even a new first day of school outfit. I have a backpack in mind. But I don't know if my mom will let me get it. It costs about $180 per backpack and lunch box duo. But I am only getting the backpack. So it will cost about $90 plus tax.</p>
